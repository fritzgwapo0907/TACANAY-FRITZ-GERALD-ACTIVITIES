        The COVID19 pandemic is a global health emergency with serious health and economic consequences. As of February 2021, the disease had infected approximately 111 million people worldwide, claimed at least 2.4 million fatalities, and been reported in 215 nations or territories since its inception in China in November 2019 (Labrague and Ballad, 2021). The World Health Organization (2021) states that, the United States of America, Brazil, India, and Russia continue to be the most impacted countries in the globe, accounting for almost 30 percent of all confirmed coronavirus infections. The Philippines had the largest number of confirmed cases and deaths in the Western Pacific Region, accounting for more than half of all cases and 40 percent of all deaths (WHO, 2020).
Many governments around the world have implemented various disease control measures, such as rigorous social distance and obligatory lockdown or stay-at-home orders, in attempt to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Starting in March 2020, the Philippines' government enforced a statewide mandatory lockdown, often known as a "community quarantine," mandating individuals to stay at home and prohibiting all physical and social activity outside the home, with exceptions for frontline and vital personnel. Furthermore, schools were physically shuttered in mid-March 2020 and are still closed as of this writing, with remote teaching and learning environments being used as a temporary alternative. These methods, together with other disease control techniques, were found to effectively reduce the number of confirmed COVID19 cases and deaths in the country as well as in other countries.
